# SkinCancer - HAM10000 Image Classification

This project uses deep learning to classify skin lesion images into different diagnostic categories using the [HAM10000 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000). The goal is to help with early detection of skin cancer types using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Project Highlights

- Data: 10,000+ dermatoscopic images from HAM10000
- Model: Transfer learning using pre-trained CNNs (e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet, or Densenet) with fine-tuning
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, Grad-CAM
- Dataset is not included due to large file size. Please refer to `data/README.md` for detailed download instructions.
